Everett's working plan

We are working on this code base as a team. I am Everett (Ev). My sister is Cordelia (Cordy). My brother is Ian. Cordy is responsible for the questions in our survey. She has written a Question list.md file.

## Current To-Do List

### 0.0.2
Figure out the code for each type of question. Multiple choice, checkbox, short answer etc...

### 0.0.3 
When returning to website show a different screen than the first time.

### 0.0.4
Parse the questions.json file and implement survey functionality:
- Create a system to load and parse the questions.json file
- Build dynamic question rendering based on question types (select, number, currency, etc.)
- Implement conditional logic for questions (askIf conditions)
- Store user answers in IndexedDB
- Create reusable components for different question types
- Handle validation and special options (Web Blank, Don't Know, etc.)
